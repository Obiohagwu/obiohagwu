Consumer llms, which I define as LLMS that are at least as good as GPT3.5 (specify which), and able to run inference, finetune, and hopefully (more superflous goal for now) train, on consumer-grade hardware (which I define as non-cluster [<200GB of VRAM, and <# of flops used to finetune >1trillion token and/or 65B-120Bparam models]).
