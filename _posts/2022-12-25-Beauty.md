This is a subject that's percolated in my mind for a fairly long time. Beauty. Intuitively, we all seemingly have this sentitivity to aesthetics. The root of this predispositin to aesthetic sensibilites is not entierly clear. Although, we do have an affinity for certain geometric simplicities superimposed on cyclical symmetries. Such ideals span multiple domains. From the beauty bilatral symmetry of humns and other such mammals, to the pentaradial symmetry exhibited by the likes of Enchoderms and other such species. There seems to be an evolutionary selection pressure that favours symmetry at varying levels of organization in living animals. Is there a reason for the apparent affinity for symmetry in nature? Off pure hypothesizing, it could be the case that symmetries are in some way, a more computatinally efficent way to instantiate objects in the physical world. Symmetry, and it's relation to physical conservation and invariance under transformations would lead to lower entropic load in the space of thermodynamic eficency. Given that any such physical system that upholds the conditions of symmetry would by definiton remain invariant, in terms of its core structure, under multiple transformations
