This is a subejct that's percolated in my mind for a fairly long time. Beauty. Intuitively, we all seemingly have this sentitivity to aesthetics. The root of this predispositin to aesthetic sensibilites is not entierly clear. Although, we do have an affinity for certain geometric simplicities superimposed on cyclical symmetries. Such ideals span multiple domains. From the beauty bilatral symmetry of humns and other such mammals, to the pentaradial symmetry exhibited by the likes of Enchoderms and other such species. There seems to be an evolutionary selection pressure that favours symmetry at varying levels of organization in living animals.
