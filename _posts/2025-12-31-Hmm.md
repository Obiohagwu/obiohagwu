Hello. It's been about 2 and a half years since I made one of these. It's good to look back and reflect on life really. 
<br>

I started writing these initially on Substack. Although I do have a bunch of unfinished posts, as my signature style engenders. 
<br>

I'm not sure what to say really. I do have a lot of new things going on vs when I was 17 in the heat of the pandemic dealing with all sorts of internal consternation and tumult. Things are materially much better now though in certain ways. Not absolutely.

Well, I'm about to undertake my 2nd serious business venture. Actually I'd say 3rd. Aside from my current nascent AI/GRAPHICS service startup, I've also been asked by a close friend of mine to help him with ML strategy for his startup. 
<br>

So I guess in regards to these little hobbies of mine I have made some material progress, although all this has been mostly within this year of 2025, and mostly within the second half of it as well.

I think I may have been in some sort of unpleasant melancholic basin; I do believe I am making good step sizes and almost see the light. 
<br>

I think I see a way out. A way to win. Hopefully my sins don't catch up to me before I can achieve actualization. As a true Catholic, I still can't escape guilt driven morality.
<br>

Happy new year to myself. Let's see what can be done, amen.
