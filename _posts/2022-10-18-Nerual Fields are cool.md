Ok so this is going to be a fairly generic type of post. A year or so ago, I was really fascinated by the propsects of deep learning on point clouds in fairly arbitrary dimensional euclidean spaces. 
Most of my fascination with such a topic was centered on it's application to deep representation learning for 3D synthesis while minizing computational load by sparsifying into point sets, or euclidean coordinates as opposed to regular voxel grids (which are a lot more "memory-sucking"). The Pointnet architecture paper published by Qi et al really months ago, I stumb
