The ideal multimodal agent would integrate an audio processing system. I decided to share some notes on speech,starting from a signal procesing perspective. 

## To begin: General raw signal transformation functions - Fourier transforms

Talk about how to sample a wave form, period, sampling frequency, and FFTs etc. 
Move on to short time fourier transforms, and how that works, and why to use it in place of canonical FFTs.
Move on to mel spectrograms, and how they can be decoded.
Do a thorough account of Vocoders (nerual vocoders). Talk about different backbones and their advantages and drawbacks
