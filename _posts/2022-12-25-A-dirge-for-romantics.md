> *A sultry diatribe for those of the more romantic disposition. Aesthete sensibilites can be deleterious.*

*A tear is shed; beauty in all it's absolute rawness<br>
To find surfeit, your tender embrace. Pain! a vitriolic immanent<br>
All we know is pain. The unending procule of eternal sunshine<br>
A terminus, fulfilled of such wretched lamentations<br>
Are we naive to hold such fanciful ideations? They say we are<br>
What more is there to all this, if not transcendence?<br>
Trancendent ideals presupposed by metafoundational artefacts - Love<br>
Warmth, feeling, thought. Cogito Ergo sum. It is upon this that we suffer<br>
Unending melancholia as an eternal dispotion, merciful is the ahedonic catanonia*
