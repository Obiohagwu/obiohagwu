A tear is shed; beauty in all it's absolute rawness
To find surfeit, your tender embrace. Pain! that is all we feel
All we know is pain. The unending procule of eternal sunshine
A terminus, fulfilled of such wretched lamentations
Are we naive to hold such fanciful ideations? They say we are
What more is there to all this, if not transcendence?
Trancendent ideals presupposed by metafoundational artefacts - Love
Warmth, feeling, thought. Cogito Ergo sum. It is upon this that we suffer
