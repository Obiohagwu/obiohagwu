Ok, to start off, I'm not entirely sure that making htis public is a good idea goven the precariousness that GPUs might inhabit in the near future as a result of the porliferation of really advanced autonomous systems.

But whatever, lol, I'm still going to document to publicly document the build, as it might be helpful to others.
