Lately, I’ve been thinking about money… and fitness and how money can act as a fairly strong proxy for fitness.

First off, let’s get some definitions clear. Fitness, in the context of evolutionary biology, entails a quantitative marker signaling the implications of sexual selection and natural selection forces in a given population. A high relative fitness score indicates a high likelihood that one’s lineage will tend to live long - and effectively, maximize the longevity of their genes and theirs of their progeny in the gene pool of subsequent generations. On a purely sociocultural/socioeconomic level - that being the most profoundly experienced by humans - one could posit the acquisition of money and power as the primary telos of most people of most cultures. As humans, it is fairly hard-wired in our DNA to maximize the length and quality of our lives and those of our family/offspring. This could imply that a “human” quasi-objective function would entail the acquisition of those markers that would maximize our relative fitness score - our chance of passing on our genetic material. In our context, such a marker can be analogous to money and/or power.
